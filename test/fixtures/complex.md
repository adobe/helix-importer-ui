With the weather cooling, leaves changing colors, and many students going back to school, autumn has long been seen as a season of change. This year, as consumers adjust to structural shifts like remote work and inflation as well as value changes like the move toward more sustainable living, brands need to rethink and refresh their creative communications.

The Adobe Stock autumn 2023 collections focus on current trends, from [mindful travel](https://stock.adobe.com/collections/t5L4SZfTRIfmqYp41lgDNngYVOAwBJxH) to [personal betterment.](https://stock.adobe.com/collections/bL6qiiMHtctYBWsaD2qzHXKkk7XScAre) In all the collections, we see diverse people striving to live more consciously and align their choices with the things that matter most to them.

## Living our values through travel, education, and self-care

People are traveling [at record levels](https://www.travelpulse.com/News/Destinations/US-Travelers-Spending-Abroad-Reaches-All-Time-High) for business, pleasure, and “bleisure.” At the same time, they’re factoring climate change into their travel decisions as they attempt to lower their carbon footprints, create less waste, and get from point A to point B more sustainably.

Global brands like Patagonia and The North Face are integrating these values into their missions and providing eco-friendly experiences to travelers. Hyper-local travel experiences are also becoming popular. For example, internet searches for “nature on your doorstep” have [increased 287 percent](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/m-_MWj4MT8iOYwOLMPKirQ) in China, and US west coast organizations like Forage SF and WildCraft Studio School are offering [mushroom foraging trips](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/travel/mushroom-foraging-west.html) and educating hikers about delicate local ecosystems.

Our Adobe Stock [Mindful and Sustainable Travel](https://stock.adobe.com/collections/t5L4SZfTRIfmqYp41lgDNngYVOAwBJxH) collection features images and videos that depict people taking part in environmentally friendly travel and outdoor activities.

Consumers' focus this season extends beyond sustainable living. They’re also looking to improve themselves through education, spending time, energy, and money learning new skills, languages, and crafts in both digital and physical settings.

[#EduTok](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/edutok?lang=en) on TikTok has over 150 billion views, with many users gravitating towards learning personal finance and career development skills. Socially integrated apps like DuoLingo, Skillshare, Masterclass, and Calm are wildly popular with people looking to pick up new skills and knowledge. People are also seeking opportunities for learning in brick-and-mortar facilities like bookstores and cafes that host book clubs, readings, and other events. Separate from work and home, these “third spaces” are fulfilling a need for education and a sense of community.

The Adobe Stock [Hybrid and Remote Learning](https://stock.adobe.com/collections/Pm4hIPDUu4WsnDuFVDUpS5fSenFZOjtm) collection spotlights all these trends, showing a variety of ways that people are pursuing education on their own terms.

When it comes to personal betterment, fitness and wellness are trending — and changing. Traditional gym memberships are seeing a substantial rebound this year, with consumers favoring gyms that put a premium on [good instructors, motivation, and accountability](https://insider.fitt.co/issue-no-213-year-end-review/). Workouts that can’t be done at home, like reformer Pilates and boot camps, are the most popular. And as people move away from activities like dieting and body sculpting to focus on their overall health and wellbeing, they now report that the biggest reason they work out is not to lose weight but to [manage stress and feel better mentally](https://www.mindbodyonline.com/sites/default/files/public/education/learning-assets/2022-MWI-Fitness-Report.pdf).

Explore our [Holistic Health and Wellness](https://stock.adobe.com/collections/bL6qiiMHtctYBWsaD2qzHXKkk7XScAre) collection for Adobe Stock assets that spotlight everything from gym workouts to self-care.

## Evolving beyond fast fashion and into slower, more sensory style

Consumers are increasingly rejecting the “hip today, passé tomorrow” ethos of fast fashion in favor of styles that are more sustainable and lasting. [Inflation is playing a part](https://blackhawknetwork.com/resources/research-inflation-other-economic-factors-driving-consumers-seek-out-deals-and-promotions-blackhawk-network?utm_source=Fletcher\&utm_medium=Press_Release\&utm_campaign=BHN_US\&utm_term=CMP-02317-Y5Q9K\&utm_content=InflationResearch_blog) as consumers look to economize, but a survey of Gen Z shoppers shows that [over 60 percent](https://www.themomentum.com/now/fashion-5-30) prefer ethical and sustainable clothing brands.

Also trending is fashion that uses texture, color, and silhouette to appeal to the senses. Check out the Adobe Stock [Fall Style](https://stock.adobe.com/collections/i8lliUIuQ3TKieXMjF1wcMtVpgGExl2a) collection to find visuals that show people delighting in how clothing looks, feels, and sounds.
